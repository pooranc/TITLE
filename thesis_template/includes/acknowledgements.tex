% I would first like to thank my thesis advisor ...
Foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, for giving me an opportunity to take up thesis and guidance. The presentations sessions every Monday during the thesis is a really good platform to learn our mistakes and improve.  I appreciate the feedback and complete freedom while working on the thesis.

I would also like to thank the resources provided by the university, the pc pool facility which is available 24 hours even on holidays, helped me a lot in completing the thesis.

I would like to recognize the help of my friends who help me to annotate the tweets and create the dataset, which was used in the thesis. I appreciate their time and efforts.

I would also like to thank my parents for their love and support.
